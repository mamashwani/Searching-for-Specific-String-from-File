# Searching-for-Specific-String-from-File
Using files to read in text data, then use data structures with loops, functions, and conditional execution.


# Description: I
- Create a program that will read a large corpus of text from a file and search for a specific string. 
- You will read all the data into a list and then search the list with both linear and binarysearches to look for a string provided by the user.
- Your program should read the entire catalog of cracked passwords from “password_long.txt” into a list, removing the return character at the end of each line as needed.
- Your program should ask the user for a password and use it to search the list.
- Your program should include functions to perform both a linear search and a binary search of the file. You may not use the keyword in to search the list.
- You should include code to count the number of comparisons needed to execute the searches and should output the count for both the linear and binary search.
